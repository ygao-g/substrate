# Agent Substrate Architecture

NOTE: Much of this architecture is aspirational, and is not yet implemented!

## Overview

Agent Substrate delivers a performant, high density runtime environment for large scale agent deployments. The agent substrate control plane provides full lifecycle management for agent sandboxes, delivering sub-second agent resume/suspend operations, and allows heavy multiplexing of agents onto the same computer infrastructure. It supports multiple sandbox technologies including microVMs and gVisor, enabling consistent lifecycle operations for all sandbox types.

At its core, Agent Substrate maps a larger set of “actors” (applications such
as agents) onto a smaller set of ready “workers”, relying on
the fact that agent-like applications tend to be idle most of the time to
achieve heavy multiplexing.  It provides functionality to manage an actor’s
lifecycle (e.g. create/destroy, suspend/resume), to assign actors to workers in real
time, and to route incoming traffic to them.


## Problem Statement
Agents and "agent-like" workloads are generally very bursty, spending most of
their time waiting for input or events, then handling those events, then going
back to waiting.  The time they spend actually doing work is often very short,
and the time they spend waiting can be unbounded.  Because they often run
untrusted logic, they are often run in sandboxes, which means they are usually
single-tenant instances, and there are a great many of them.

## Core Concepts and Approaches

### Terminology: "Actor"

Agent Substrate seeks to solve these problems for "agent-like" workloads.
Often we simply say "agents", but it's important to clarify that "agent-like"
workloads are not necessarily literally AI agents.  In most of the docs we
instead use the term "actor" to refer to an instance of an agent-like workload.

### Decoupling the Actor Lifecycle from Workers (Kubernetes Pods)

Since many agents run untrusted code, we need to run them in sandboxes of some
sort. Agent Substrate is designed to support multiple sandbox technologies with
[gVisor](http://gvisor.dev) and micro-VMs such as
[Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) being popular options. Both
of those happen to support a notion of suspend and resume which is core for the Agent Substrate functionality.

Agent Substrate starts with suspend and resume.  When an actor is idle, we
suspend it, which frees up the resources it was consuming.  When an event comes
in that needs to be handled, we resume the actor.  To avoid the latency of
going through the Kubernetes scheduler, we pre-start long-running "worker"
Pods, which are just sandboxes waiting for work.  When an event comes in, we
assign it to a worker, which resumes the actor in that worker.  We can now
multiplex a larger number of actors onto a smaller number of workers, which
allows us to achieve higher density and efficiency, while also reducing
latency.

### A Focused Control Plane

Agent Substrate includes a small, focused control-plane component which
focuses on high scale, QPS and low-latency suspend/resume operations for actors (Agent Sandboxes). It relies on the Kubernetes control plane for infrastructure and worker (Pods) provisioning which are low-frequency operations that align well with Kubernetes' strength in the infrastructure lifecycle management and workload resource isolation.

### Agent-Aware Routing

In order to achieve on-demand resuming of actors, we need to be able to trap and
inspect network traffic.  Agent Substrate includes a lightweight,
substrate-aware network proxy which can inspect incoming traffic and trigger
the resumption of actors as needed.

### New Problems

Of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and these approaches have
trade-offs.

First, we trade one problem (many idle Pods consuming resources) for another.
Doing suspend and resume at this scale introduces a vast data management
problem.  We need to store the state of millions of actors, which can update
many times per second.  Agent Substrate will need to consider data locality as
a first-class concern.  When an event comes in, we need to know where the
actor's most recent state is stored, and either route the event to that
location or move the state to where the event can be serviced.

In addition to that, we must acknowledge that building a new production-grade
control-plane component is a non-trivial effort.  It will need to be highly
available, secure, and performant, and it will need to integrate well with
Kubernetes.

Another problem to consider is observability and debugging.  With actors being
multiplexed onto and off of workers all the time, it will be more difficult to
understand what is happening. Agent Substrate will need to provide robust
tooling for monitoring and debugging actors, including the ability to thread
together metrics and logs for an actor over time, to inspect the state of
suspended actors, and to trace the events that lead to their current state.

### Problems We Haven't Addressed Yet

As early as this project is, there are several problems that we haven't even
started to tackle yet, but which we know will need to be solved eventually.

  * Autoscaling: We will need to be able to automatically scale the number of workers up
    and down based on demand.  Kubernetes Pod autoscaling may be sufficient or
    it might not.
  * Peer to peer state sharing: Relying on data locality presents a risk of
    data loss.  We probably need some form of state-sharing to protect against
    that, which needs to be balanced with saving state to a "permanent" store.
  * Control plane authn/z: We will need to ensure that the control plane is secure, and that only
    authorized users and agents can interact with it.
  * Identity and policy: We know that agents' needs for identity are very
    different than traditional workload identity and end-user credentials.
  * There are certainly more that we haven't thought of yet!

## North Star Metrics

Agent Substrate is an ambitious effort.  To keep us focused on the right
problems, we have identified a few north star metrics and targets.

  * Activation Latency: The time from when a wakeup event is received to when
    the agent can receive traffic.
    - Target: 100ms at 95th percentile
  * Scale: The total number of agents, active and idle, that can be supported
    in a single cluster.
    - Target: 1 billion
  * Throughput: The number of wakeup events that can be handled per second in
    a single cluster.
    - Target: 1000/second

## Personas

There are a few different personas that interact with the system:

  1) **Cluster admins**: These are the people who own the Kubernetes cluster and
     are responsible for its overall health and performance.  If the Agent
     Substrate needs more capacity, these are the folks who manage things like
     cluster autoscaling, node provisioning, and so on.  They probably don't
     need to interact directly with the Agent Substrate much, if ever.

  2) **Substrate admins**: These are the people who set up and own the Agent
     Substrate instance(s) in a Kubernetes cluster.  They are obviously aware
     that it is running in a Kubernetes cluster, and are responsible for
     configuring the Kubernetes resources for it (such as WorkerPools).

  3) **Agent developers**: These are the people who deploy agents into a substrate
     for users or higher-level systems to consume. They might have to be aware
     that they are using Kubernetes (some concepts are represented as CRDs,
     such as ActorTemplates), or they might be using a higher level API which
     itself uses Agent Substrate under the hood.

  4) **Agent users**: These are the people who interact with agents running in the
     substrate.  They might be end-users of an application that is built on top
     of Agent Substrate, or they might be higher-level systems that are using
     Agent Substrate as a building block. They should not need to be aware that
     they are using Kubernetes at all.

## Relationship to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the industry standard platform for running modern workloads.  It
is built to support a wide array of workloads, and it can scale to very large
clusters. Agent Substrate leverages Kubernetes for infrastructure provisioning and worker lifecycle management (Kubernetes Pods). It builds on top of Kubernetes features like Pods and Pod autoscaling, while Agent Substrate provides agent-specific scheduling and control to achieve lower latency. Using Kubernetes as the underlying system enables consistent infrastructure management across all workloads types that are required for end to end agentic deployments and allows holistic infrastructure optimizations for RL scenarios that span agentic, inference and training cycles.

### Why do we need a specialized control plane for Agent Substrate?
 * Idle Pods still consume resources.  While Kubernetes is very scalable,
   compute capacity is finite and has real costs.  Whether we're talking about
   CPU time, memory space, or just the number of Pods per node, agent-like
   workloads are terrible for efficiency.
 * The Kubernetes API server is not designed to handle millions of resources.
   It excels at reconciling resources asynchronously across many controllers,
   but it is not so good at storing very large numbers of discrete resources,
   or for handling a huge volume of write traffic.
 * Scheduling a workload on Kubernetes requires several asynchronous processes
   to converge, plus several network hops, plus image pulling and other steps,
   which can add up.  Getting a Pod running in a couple of seconds is great
   when that Pod will run for hours or days, but for a workload that will run
   for milliseconds to low-digit seconds, that latency is unacceptable.
 * State management is difficult.  Kubernetes provides an API for managing
   state (PersistentVolumes), but it is not designed for millions of volumes,
   with widely varying amounts of data, being attached and detached at high
   Speed.
Using a specialized Agent Substrate control plane for Actor allows us to achieve high scale and low latency control. We still rely on Kubernetes for infrastructure provisioning, such as worker pods, and workload isolation, which is what Kubernetes excels at.

## High-Level Design

A substrate admin deploys the Agent Substrate into a Kubernetes cluster.  They
configure the WorkerPool(s) that will be used to execute actors and prepare the
substrate's control-plane for use.  Worker Pods are started, waiting for
assignments.

An agent developer defines an ActorTemplate (a CR) which describes what it
means to instantiate that actor - what OCI image to run, how much memory it
needs, behavioral parameters, etc.  The Agent Substrate uses that ActorTemplate
to create a "golden snapshot" of the actor, which will be used to fast-start
instances of that actor in the future.

An agent user (or a higher-level system) makes a request to instantiate an
actor.  They specify which ActorTemplate to use and other parameters.  The
Agent Substrate creates an Actor record in its control-plane storage, which
tracks the state of that actor (suspended or running).

When a request comes in for that actor instance, the Agent Substrate's proxy
intercepts the request.  It looks in the control-plane to determine if that
actor is currently running or not.  If not, it assigns the actor to a worker,
which involves telling a node-level component (the "atelet") to restore the
actor's most-recent snapshot into the worker on that node.  The request is then
forwarded to the actor.

Eventually, the user (or the higher-level system) is done with the actor, or it
has been idle for a while.  It can request the Agent Substrate to suspend the
actor, taking a snapshot and freeing up the worker.  The next time a request
comes in for that actor, it will be resumed again, possibly on a different
worker.

## API Resource Models

Agent Substrate categorizes resources into two groups based on their
persistence requirements and the frequency of state transitions.

### System Configuration (Declarative/CRD-based)

These resources define the intended state of the system and are managed via
Kubernetes CRD APIs. They are used for administrative operations and actor
environment definitions.

  * **WorkerPool**: Defines a pool of "warm" compute capacity. It manages a
    fleet of standby worker pods initialized and ready to receive resumed actor
    states. Optional `spec.template` fields configure worker pod node
    selection, tolerations, priority class, and node affinity.

  * **ActorTemplate**: An immutable definition of an actor-version. It
    encapsulates the container image, configuration, and environment required
    to generate a "golden" snapshot.

### Dynamic Instance State (Database-based)

These resources represent the high-frequency, ephemeral state of individual
actors and workers. They are stored in a high-performance, low-latency state
store (currently ValKey/Redis) to support real-time operations.

  * **Actor**: A specific instance of an ActorTemplate. An Actor record tracks
    its globally unique identifier, physical location (Worker IP), current
    state (RUNNING or SUSPENDED), and version-specific state metadata.

  * **Worker**: A representation of a worker pod in the WorkerPool. It tracks
    the worker's unique identifier, current status (IDLE or BUSY), and the
    Actor it is currently hosting (if any).

### Architectural Rationale

Agent Substrate utilizes this dual-layer model to optimize for both Reliability
and Performance:

  1.  **Scalability**: Offloading the high-frequency, high-scale management of
      millions of actors to a specialized state store prevents overwhelming the
      primary cluster control plane with thousands of updates per second.

  2.  **Latency**: Achieving 100ms resumption requires low-latency state
      lookups and atomic worker assignments that bypass the eventual
      consistency and variable latency of standard Kubernetes API servers.

  3.  **Governance**: Using Kubernetes objects for the environment (WorkerPools
      and Templates) allows platform teams to apply familiar RBAC, auditing,
      and policy enforcement to the underlying infrastructure.

### Resource Model

The CRDs and control-plane records described above, with their relationships and
multiplicities (UML class diagram):

```mermaid
classDiagram
    namespace kube-apiserver {
        class ActorTemplate {
            <<CRD>>
        }
        class WorkerPool {
            <<CRD>>
        }
        class Deployment
        class WorkerPod {
            ateom
            runsc
        }
    }

    namespace ate-api-server {
        class Actor {
            <<record>>
            status
            snapshotRefs
        }
        class Worker {
            <<record>>
            actorName
            podIP
        }
    }

    ActorTemplate "1" --> "1" WorkerPool : workerPoolRef
    WorkerPool ..> Deployment : reconciled by atecontroller
    Deployment "1" *-- "*" WorkerPod : manages
    Actor ..> ActorTemplate : derived from
    Actor "0..1" --> "0..1" Worker : runs on
    Worker "1" --> "1" WorkerPod : maps to
```

## System Components

### Control Plane (`ate-api-server`)

The brain of the system. It exposes a gRPC API for the data plane and CLI to
manage actor lifecycles.

  * **State Store**: Tracks the mapping of Actors to Workers in a
    high-performance Redis store.

  * **Scheduler**: Selects a ready worker for a resumption request.

  * **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates the multi-step Resume/Suspend sequences
    (lock acquisition, storage download, sandbox restore).

### Node Supervisor (`atelet` + `ateom`)

The node-level subsystem manages the physical execution of sandboxes and the movement of snapshots.

  * **atelet**: A lightweight supervisor running on each node as a DaemonSet. It acts as the "Herder," managing a pool of physical pods and communicating with the Control Plane.

  * **ateom**: A specialized sandbox-herder container image — one per sandbox class (`ateom-gvisor`, `ateom-microvm`) — that runs inside the physical worker pods. It provides a gRPC interface for `atelet` to trigger `RunWorkload`, `CheckpointWorkload`, and `RestoreWorkload` operations. This separation ensures that the physical pod lifecycle remains decoupled from the sandboxed agent process.

  * **Lifecycle Management**: The `ateom` process invokes the sandbox runtime to checkpoint or restore processes within the physical pod boundaries — `runsc` for gVisor, or the Kata + Cloud Hypervisor stack for micro-VMs. (Note: the gVisor backend currently requires a `runsc` version with the `--allow-connected-on-save` flag to work around a bug in networking resumption during checkpointing.)

  * **Storage Mover**: The `atelet` streams snapshots to and from GCS/S3, ensuring process state is persistent and portable across the cluster.

### Sandbox Classes

A `WorkerPool` selects a **sandbox class** (`spec.sandboxClass`), and each class has a matching `ateom` herder image. The sandbox binaries themselves are not baked into the worker image — they, and the pause image holding the sandbox's namespaces, come at runtime from a cluster-scoped [`SandboxConfig`](api-guide.md#3-sandboxconfig-the-sandbox-itself) and are pinned into each snapshot's manifest so restores stay reproducible across runtime upgrades.

  * **gVisor** (`ateom-gvisor`, the default): Runs the workload under `runsc` for kernel-level sandboxing. Suspend and resume leverage gVisor's native checkpoint/restore of the sandboxed process tree.

  * **micro-VM** (`ateom-microvm`): Runs the workload inside a [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) guest on the [Cloud Hypervisor](https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/) VMM. Suspend and resume capture a memory-only VM snapshot and restore it on-demand using `userfaultfd` memory demand-paging, with container rootfs writes captured in guest RAM via a `tmpfs` overlay. `DurableDir` volumes are host-backed instead, served over a second (writable) virtio-fs share and shipped in snapshots as a tar, so a `Data`-scope snapshot can capture them without any guest memory. Each volume is a subdirectory of that one share, so an actor can have several at no extra cost in devices — which is why the micro-VM class lifts the single-`DurableDir` limit that still applies to gVisor.

### Networking Stack (`atenet` DNS + `atunnel`)

Handles actor-aware routing and automatic re-animation.

  * **Uniform DNS Mesh**: Substrate provides a location-transparent actor discovery scheme via a global DNS suffix (`<actor-name>.<atespace>.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev`).

  * **Ingress Routing**: `atenet-router` runs Envoy with an `ext_proc` external
    processor and accepts HTTP traffic for the Actor DNS suffix. The ext_proc
    extracts the Actor name and Atespace from the `Host` header and calls the
    Control Plane to resume the Actor and resolve its current worker assignment.

  * **Worker Tunnel**: After resolving the assignment, `atenet-router` opens an
    authenticated TLS tunnel to the worker's `atunnel` listener on port 443.
    `atunnel`, hosted by `ateom`, forwards the request to the active Actor over
    its private veth interface. Worker pod port 80 is not a direct Actor ingress
    path.

  * **Arbitrary-Port Ingress**: A client reaches a port on the Actor other than
    its default (80) with an HTTP `CONNECT` request naming the port in the
    authority (e.g. `CONNECT <actor-dns>:9090`), rather than a separate header
    or field. `atenet-router` terminates the `CONNECT` on a dedicated listener
    and re-enters the tunneled traffic through the same ingress path as
    ordinary requests, so each request inside a long-lived tunnel still
    resumes the Actor and re-routes it independently if it moves workers. Only
    HTTP(S) traffic over the tunnel is supported today; raw TCP or other
    non-HTTP protocols on a non-default port are not yet reachable this way.

  * **Latency**: The data plane is optimized for sub-100ms activation by bypassing Kubernetes' eventual consistency and performing atomic physical assignments.

## Actor Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an actor follows a state-driven sequence. A request reaches an
actor through the networking stack, which resumes it onto a worker if it is
suspended (UML sequence diagram):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client
    participant DNS as atenet DNS
    participant Gateway as atenet-router
    participant API as ate-api-server
    participant Atelet as atelet
    participant Tunnel as ateom / atunnel
    participant A as Actor
    participant Store as snapshot storage

    Client->>DNS: resolve actor DNS name
    DNS-->>Client: ingress gateway address
    Client->>Gateway: HTTP request (Host = actor)
    Gateway->>API: ResumeActor(atespace, actor name)
    API->>Atelet: Restore
    Store-->>Atelet: download snapshot
    Atelet->>Tunnel: RestoreWorkload
    Note over Tunnel: restore sandbox and activate Actor network
    Tunnel-->>Atelet: ready
    Atelet-->>API: worker pod IP
    API-->>Gateway: worker assignment
    Gateway->>Tunnel: mTLS tunnel to worker port 443
    Tunnel->>A: forward request to Actor port
    A-->>Tunnel: response
    Tunnel-->>Gateway: response
    Gateway-->>Client: response
    Note over API,Store: later: an explicit SuspendActor checkpoints back to storage and frees the worker
```

An Actor's `state` moves through these states (UML state machine diagram):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> SUSPENDED : CreateActor
    SUSPENDED --> RESUMING : ResumeActor
    RESUMING --> RUNNING : restore / boot complete
    RUNNING --> SUSPENDING : SuspendActor
    SUSPENDING --> SUSPENDED : checkpoint complete
    RUNNING --> PAUSING : PauseActor
    PAUSING --> PAUSED : node-local checkpoint complete
    PAUSED --> RESUMING : ResumeActor (pinned to the snapshot's node)
    PAUSED --> SUSPENDING : SuspendActor (uploads the node-local snapshot)
    SUSPENDED --> [*] : DeleteActor
```

### Phase 1: Creation (`CreateActor`)

A user or framework calls `CreateActor` with a unique ID and a reference to an
`ActorTemplate`.

  * **State**: The actor is registered in the database with state
    `ACTOR_STATE_SUSPENDED`.

  * **State**: The record is initialized in the database with the metadata and
    **Golden Snapshot** (Version 0) reference derived from the associated
    ActorTemplate. This ensures the actor can be instantly hydrated into a warm
    worker upon its first request.

### Phase 2: Activation (`ResumeActor`)

Triggered by an inbound request at the Gateway or an explicit API call.

  1. **Trigger**: The Gateway pauses the request and asks the Control Plane for
     the actor's location.

  2. **Assignment**: The Control Plane claims a warm worker from the
     `WorkerPool`.

  3. **Hydration**: The `atelet` supervisor coordinates with the `ateom` process inside the worker pod to restore the ActorTemplate's golden `ActorSnapshot` (for first-run) or the Actor's latest `ActorSnapshot` (for recurring runs) into the sandbox.

  4. **State**: State transitions to `ACTOR_STATE_RUNNING`. The actor now has an
     active Worker IP.

  5. **Response**: The Control Plane returns the worker assignment to the
     Gateway. The Gateway opens an authenticated tunnel to `atunnel` on that
     worker, which forwards the original request to the active Actor.

### Phase 3: Hibernation (`SuspendActor`)

Triggered by an explicit `SuspendActor` call.

  1. **Checkpoint**: The `atelet` instructs `ateom` to freeze the process and capture a memory+disk snapshot.

  2. **Persistence**: The `atelet` streams the snapshot from the pod to durable storage (e.g., GCS).

  3. **Reclaim**: The physical worker is wiped and returned to the `WorkerPool`.

  4. **State**: State transitions back to `ACTOR_STATE_SUSPENDED`, now pointing to
     an immutable `ActorSnapshot` resource and references it for future resumptions.

Snapshots may be given tags owned and addressed by an Atespace. The same tag
name may exist in different Atespaces. A tag is an immutable alias and retention
pin: publishing it permits reuse from other Atespaces without changing its
`atespace/name` address. Deleting the owning Atespace deletes all of its tags,
including published tags, but leaves snapshot cleanup to garbage collection.

### Phase 4: Deletion

By default, only actors in `ACTOR_STATE_SUSPENDED` or `ACTOR_STATE_CRASHED` state can be deleted from the Control Plane. With the `any_state` flag enabled, an actor in any state (such as `ACTOR_STATE_RUNNING` or `ACTOR_STATE_PAUSED`) can be deleted directly; the workflow terminates the running containers on the worker, detaches mounted volumes, and frees the worker assignment before deleting the record.

After deletion, the state of the actor (i.e., memory+disk snapshots) is garbage collected. The garbage collection process is not implemented yet.

## State Management & Persistence

Agent Substrate distinguishes between two types of state, which are currently
captured together in a single versioned snapshot:

  1.  **Memory Snapshot**: The exact RAM state of the process.

  2.  **Working Volume (Disk)**: The files written to the container's writable
      layer (the "working memory").

In the current implementation, both memory and disk states are tied to the
specific version of the code (ActorTemplate). This ensures strict consistency
during resumption.

Snapshots are stored durably in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**. This model
allows the physical compute resources in the `WorkerPool` to be fully reclaimed
while an actor is idle, without losing any process or filesystem progress.

## Security & Isolation

Agent Substrate is built on a **Defense-in-Depth** model:

  * **Sandboxed Execution**: Every actor runs inside a hardened kernel-space
    isolation layer (e.g. gVisor), preventing container escapes.

  * **Actor Identity**: Every interaction is powered by a unique, Agent
    Substrate-managed identity that is independent of the underlying hardware.
    This ensures that actors maintain their own granular permissions and
    security context even as they migrate across physical nodes or code
    versions.

  * **Request Authorization**: The system currently performs **Identity-Aware
    Routing** by utilizing a uniform DNS routing scheme
    (`<actor-name>.<atespace>.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev`)
    at the gateway to extract and validate actor identifiers from incoming traffic. This
    ensures requests are only routed to recognized, registered actors.
    Pluggable, granular authorization policies are planned for future
    milestones.

  * **Network Policy**: Agent Substrate leverages standard Kubernetes
    NetworkPolicy for connectivity control. Policies can be applied at the
    `WorkerPool` boundary to restrict ingress/egress traffic for all actors
    hosted within that pool.

  * **mTLS Everywhere**: All internal system communication (e.g., Control Plane
    to Atelet) is secured via mutual TLS with short-lived certificates.
