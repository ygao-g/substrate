# OpenTelemetry Collector Best Practices

This document covers how to deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector for Agent
Substrate in a Kubernetes cluster, and how to point Substrate's components at
it.

For how to *instrument* a Substrate service, see
[Tracing Best Practices](tracing.md). For what Substrate emits and where it
shows up, see [Actor Observability](../../observability.md).

## What Is Available

| | Topology | Who operates it |
|---|---|---|
| [GKE Managed OpenTelemetry](#gke-managed-opentelemetry-gke-only) | Deployment behind a ClusterIP Service | GKE |
| [Self-managed DaemonSet](#self-managed-daemonset) | One collector per node | You |
| [kind](#local-development-kind) | Single-replica Deployment plus Jaeger | Bundled with `install-ate-kind.sh` |

This guide does not recommend one over another — that depends on your cluster,
your telemetry volume, and who is on call for the collector. It documents what
each option is and what follows from it.

Whichever you run, it must terminate OTLP/gRPC on port **4317**. Substrate
cannot use the HTTP endpoint on 4318 — see
[Constraints](#constraints-you-cannot-configure-around).

## GKE Managed OpenTelemetry (GKE only)

GKE can run and upgrade the collector for you. See
[Managed OpenTelemetry for GKE](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/managed-otel-gke)
for the authoritative documentation.

Enable it on an existing cluster:

```bash
gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --managed-otel-scope=COLLECTION_AND_INSTRUMENTATION_COMPONENTS
```

(`--managed-otel-scope=NONE` disables it again.)

You get a collector reachable at:

```
opentelemetry-collector.gke-managed-otel.svc.cluster.local:4317
```

When running on GKE, this is the address every Substrate manifest already
defaults to, so no further configuration is needed. Telemetry is forwarded to
Google Cloud Observability and surfaces in Cloud Trace, Cloud Monitoring, and
Cloud Logging.

**The feature is in Preview.** It is subject to Pre-GA Offerings Terms, and
it is GKE-only — nothing about it transfers to EKS, AKS, or on-prem.

### Topology

Managed OTel runs as an HPA-scaled Deployment behind one ClusterIP Service — a
gateway tier that every pod in the cluster sends to over the network. On a GKE
1.36 cluster with the feature enabled it was 4 replicas, HPA bounds 1–5,
targeting 80% CPU and memory.

## Self-Managed DaemonSet

One collector per node, receiving **traces, metrics, and logs** over OTLP.
Pods reach the collector on their own node through a Service with
`internalTrafficPolicy: Local`, which keeps a stable DNS name while never
routing off-node.

All three signals share the single OTLP receiver on port 4317 — there is no
separate port or receiver per signal, only a separate pipeline.

If you want the agent topology, this manifest provides it. Its configuration
mirrors the practices in GKE's own managed collector — per-signal batching, a
memory limiter, layered pod association, gRPC keepalive, and a self-metrics
pipeline — adapted for a node-local agent and a backend-agnostic exporter.

Save as `otel-collector-daemonset.yaml` and `kubectl apply -f` it.

```

Then point Substrate at it:

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://opentelemetry-collector.otel-system.svc:4317
```

### Choosing an Exporter

The manifest ships with the `debug` exporter so you can verify delivery
immediately, but it only writes to the collector's own stdout. Replace it
with a real backend:

- **Google Cloud** — `googlecloud` (or `otlp` to `telemetry.googleapis.com:443`
  with the `googleclientauth` extension, which is what managed OTel itself
  does).
- **Jaeger / Tempo / any OTLP backend** — `otlp` pointed at the backend's
  gRPC endpoint.
- **Prometheus** — the `prometheus` exporter, scraped from the collector.

### Verifying Delivery

Send a request through the router, then check the collector:

```bash
kubectl logs -n otel-system daemonset/opentelemetry-collector | grep -A5 ResourceSpans
```

You should see `service.name` values matching Substrate's components —
`ateapi`, `atelet`, `atenet-router-envoy`, and any instrumented actors.

If you have a workload exporting OTLP logs, the same command shows
`ResourceLog` blocks alongside the spans. Records should carry
`k8s.pod.name` and `k8s.namespace.name`; if they do not, `k8s_attributes`
failed to associate them — check that the ClusterRole is bound.

## Pointing Substrate at Your Collector

Every Substrate component reads the standard
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable. The endpoint appears in
these manifests:

| File | Component |
|---|---|
| `manifests/ate-install/ate-api-server.yaml` | ateapi |
| `manifests/ate-install/ate-controller.yaml` | ate-controller |
| `manifests/ate-install/atelet.yaml` | atelet |
| `manifests/ate-install/atenet-router.yaml` | atenet-router (and, indirectly, its Envoy) |
| `benchmarking/locust/manifests/locust.yaml` | load generators |

Setting the variable is sufficient for every component. Two also expose a flag
that defaults to it, so you should not normally need either:
`ate-controller`'s `--otel-exporter-otlp-endpoint`, which it also propagates to
the `ateom` worker pods it creates, and `atenet-router`'s
`--otlp-collector-address`, which is what its Envoy is given over xDS.

Rather than editing the base manifests, prefer a kustomize overlay that
patches the variable — see `manifests/ate-install/kind/kustomization.yaml`
for a worked example.

### A Note on Logs

The collector configs here include a logs pipeline, but **Substrate does not
currently export logs over OTLP.** `serverboot.InitLogger` writes structured
JSON to stdout, and `ateom` wraps actor container output with the `ate.*`
metadata labels described in
[Actor Observability](../../observability.md) — also on stdout. There is no
`LoggerProvider` or OTLP log exporter in `internal/serverboot`, alongside
`InitTracing` and `InitMetrics`.

Those labels sit in a nested group (`labels`, or `logging.googleapis.com/labels`
on GKE, where the key promotes the group into `LogEntry.labels`). A filelog
receiver picking these lines up wants them as flat record attributes, which is
one OTTL statement rather than a change to the producer:

```yaml
transform:
  log_statements:
    - merge_maps(attributes, attributes["labels"], "upsert") where attributes["labels"] != nil
```

The trace-context fields (`trace_id`, `span_id`, `trace_flags`) are already
top-level and lowercase hex, so the filelog receiver's `trace_parser` maps them
onto the log record's own trace fields with no transformation.

Those logs are collected by whatever agent already reads container stdout on
your nodes — Cloud Logging's agent on GKE, or your own. The collector is not
in that path.

The logs pipeline is therefore there for **your** workloads: actors or
services instrumented with the OpenTelemetry logs SDK that push OTLP log
records to the same endpoint. It costs nothing to leave configured, and it
means an actor that adopts OTLP logging needs no collector change.

## Constraints You Cannot Configure Around

These are properties of Substrate's current exporter setup
(`internal/serverboot/serverboot.go`), not of your collector. Tracked in
[#563](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/issues/563).

**TLS is not supported.** The exporters are constructed with
`otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure()`, which overrides scheme inference, so setting
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://…` does **not** produce a TLS
connection — it silently stays plaintext. Keep the collector in-cluster and
let it own the authenticated hop to your backend.

TODO: align this with the pod-certificate mTLS the other in-cluster hops
already use.

**The protocol is fixed to gRPC.** `otlptracegrpc` and `otlpmetricgrpc` are
compiled in, so `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` is ignored. Your
collector must expose an OTLP **gRPC** receiver, and the endpoint must name
port **4317**, not 4318 — including on GKE managed OTel, whose documentation
advertises the 4318 HTTP endpoint.

**`atenet-router` disables Envoy-side tracing on an endpoint Envoy cannot
use.** Envoy's tracer cluster is plaintext h2c, so an `https://` endpoint is
neither honored nor silently downgraded: the router logs a warning, turns
Envoy-side tracing off, and starts normally. Its own spans are unaffected.
Taking the xDS control plane down for every ingress Envoy over a tracing
endpoint that works fine for the router's own exporter would be the larger
failure.

## Local Development (kind)

`hack/install-ate-kind.sh` installs a collector plus a Jaeger all-in-one into
the `otel-system` namespace — see
`manifests/ate-install/kind/otel-collector.yaml`. It is a single-replica
Deployment, which is appropriate for a one-node kind cluster. The kind
overlay patches every component's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to point at
it.

View traces:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n otel-system svc/jaeger 16686:16686
# then open http://localhost:16686
```

## Sizing and What to Watch

The collector reports on itself. The DaemonSet config above routes its
self-metrics through a dedicated `metrics/self` pipeline so they reach the
same backend as everything else; managed OTel does the equivalent internally.
Regardless of topology, these are the ones that tell you it is struggling:

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `otelcol_receiver_refused_spans` | Collector rejected data — it is saturated |
| `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans` | Backend rejected or was unreachable |
| `otelcol_exporter_queue_size` vs `_capacity` | Queue filling — shedding is imminent |
| `otelcol_processor_incoming_items` vs `_outgoing_items` | Gap means a processor is dropping data |

### The volume model

The telemetry of substrate has two independent rate drivers, and each one
increases on a different axis.

The model below gives the shape of each driver. It gives no values: those
change with the instruments of each release and with the cluster. Measure them
with the telemetry meter, which counts by service. See
[benchmarking/observability.md](../../../benchmarking/observability.md) for the
scenario ladder.

**The metrics increase with the number of components that run**, not with the
quantity of work that they do:

```
datapoints/min ≈  nodes                  × atelet_dp
                + ateapi_replicas        × ateapi_dp
                + router_replicas        × router_dp
                + worker_pods            × ateom_dp
                + instrumented_actors    × actor_dp
```

Each substrate binary pushes on a `PeriodicReader` at the SDK default of 60s,
with no jitter (`newMeterProvider` in
[`serverboot.go`](../../../internal/serverboot/serverboot.go)). Thus processes
that start together also push together. The request rate changes this term
only a small quantity. A large increase in the actor lifecycle rate moves the
datapoint volume very little.

Do not assume a value for any term. Each release can add or remove instruments,
thus a component that sends little today can send much later, and a component
that looks silent may not be. Measure the terms for your own cluster with the
telemetry meter, which counts by service; see
[benchmarking/telemetry/README.md](../../../benchmarking/telemetry/README.md).

One term is a matter of configuration and not of volume: an actor container
sends telemetry only if its image has instrumentation **and** its ActorTemplate
sets an OTLP endpoint. Substrate puts no OTLP configuration in an actor
container.

**The traces increase with the rate of the operations:**

```
spans/sec ≈ (actor_lifecycle_ops/sec + actor_requests/sec)
            × P(root sampled)
            × spans_per_op
```

Measure `spans_per_op` for your own cluster at a low sample rate, where no
component drops data, then hold it as a constant for the higher rates. The
share of each component moves with the code path that the load uses, thus read
it from the meter for the scenario you run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **With `ParentBased`, the caller makes the root decision.** Since
> [#711](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/pull/711) the defaults are
> `ParentBased(TraceIDRatioBased)` at 0.1 for `ateapi`, `atelet`, and `ateom-*`,
> and 0.01 for `atenet-router` and Envoy. These rates apply only to an operation
> that arrives with no `traceparent`. A client that sends a `traceparent` makes
> the decision for the full chain, and the defaults of substrate do not apply.
> To change the rate for one process, set `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` and
> `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`.

The metrics are the limit in a cluster with many components. The traces are the
limit in a cluster with much load. Calculate the size for the larger of the
two. If the collector becomes full, decrease the trace sample rate first.

### Deployment or DaemonSet

Users frequently ask at which throughput the collector must change from a
Deployment to a DaemonSet. The measurements show that **throughput is the wrong
axis**. At the maximum actor throughput of substrate, the collector used a
small part of its memory limit and of its CPU limit. But it stayed at
`maxReplicas` at the same time. A rule that uses throughput shows a large
margin during all of this condition.

The variable that sets the limit is the **number of pods in the cluster**,
because of the size of the `k8sattributes` cache:

| Mode | Cache in each instance | When the cluster becomes larger |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | O(pods in the cluster) | Increases with no limit. The HPA cannot decrease it. |
| DaemonSet, filter scoped to the node | O(pods on the node) | Stays in a limit, because a node holds a limited number of pods |

The DaemonSet is better only **with** `k8sattributes` scoped to the node
(`filter: node_from_env_var`). Without this scope, a DaemonSet is worse: the
cache is not sharded per node, thus each node keeps one full copy of the
cluster cache.

Make the decision in this sequence:

1. **Do you need trace-complete processing?** Tail sampling needs all the spans
   of a trace in one instance, thus a DaemonSet breaks it. To keep a DaemonSet,
   add a gateway tier behind `loadbalancingexporter`, which sends all the spans
   of one trace to the same instance. `spanmetrics` does not need this: it reads
   each span on its own. This condition frequently makes the decision.
2. **The number of pods in the cluster.** In a small cluster, a Deployment is
   more simple and less expensive. As the cluster becomes larger, the cache
   term increases until the Deployment has no margin for the HPA. Measure the
   memory of each replica against the number of pods to find this point for
   your own cluster.
3. **The concentration on each node**, if some nodes hold workloads that send
   much telemetry.

Calculate the cost in the other direction also. A DaemonSet puts one collector
on each node, and each collector has an idle memory floor. Thus a DaemonSet
uses *more* memory in total than a small number of Deployment replicas, until
the cache term becomes larger than that floor. The crossover point is the value
to measure.
