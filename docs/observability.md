# Actor Observability in Agent Substrate

Agent Substrate manages actors as virtually long-lived entities that can be suspended when idle and resumed on different Kubernetes worker pods over time.

This guide explains how Agent Substrate achieves observability across these suspend/resume cycles, allowing you to monitor logs, metrics, and traces as if an actor has been continuously running on a single dedicated machine.

## The Observability Model

To make underlying infrastructure transitions transparent, Agent Substrate establishes a standardized metadata model to identify actors across worker pods. These are the same `ate.*` keys the spans and metrics below use, defined once in [`internal/ateattr`](../internal/ateattr):
* `ate.actor.name`: The name of the actor (e.g., `my-counter-1` or `test`).
* `ate.atespace`: The atespace the actor lives in (e.g., `ate-demo-counter`).
* `ate.actor.uid`: Server-assigned UID of the actor, unique to the lifetime of an actor.
* `ate.template.name`: The name of the actor's ActorTemplate (e.g., `counter`).
* `ate.template.atespace`: The atespace of the actor's ActorTemplate (e.g., `ate-demo-counter`).
* `ate.actor.container.name`: The name of the container within the actor that produced the log line (e.g., `counter`), so a multi-container actor's logs can be demultiplexed by container. Absent on the synthetic lifecycle records (`Actor starting`, `Actor restored`, …): those are about the actor, so no container produced them.

Currently, Agent Substrate automatically wraps container output and injects these metadata labels into **container logs**. For metrics and distributed tracing, Agent Substrate provides foundational system telemetry and on-demand request tracing, with roadmap plans to fully integrate actor-level correlation.

`ate.*` is reserved for Substrate. An actor's own log lines pass through untouched except for keys in that namespace, which are dropped before the record is written, so nothing a workload emits can be read as platform-issued attribution.

---

## 1. Logging

Agent Substrate captures container standard output/error, wraps them into structured JSON log entries, and injects the `ate.*` metadata labels.

### Active Actor Inspection via CLI
For quick, on-demand debugging of an active actor, use the Agent Substrate CLI:

```bash
kubectl ate logs actors <actor-name> --atespace <atespace> [--follow / -f]
```

`--atespace` (short form `-a`) is required: actor names are only unique within
an atespace, so an actor is always addressed by `(atespace, name)`.

> **Note:** By default, `kubectl ate logs` queries the Kubernetes API of the worker pod where the actor is *currently* running. It is designed for immediate inspection of active actors. To view historical logs across past worker pods and suspension cycles, use a centralized logging backend.

#### Example 1: Actor Not Currently Running
If an actor is suspended or not assigned to a worker pod, the CLI informs you immediately:

```bash
$ kubectl ate logs actors test -a demo
Error: actor test is not currently running on any worker pod
```

#### Example 2: Default Clean JSON Lines Output
When an active actor is assigned to a worker pod, the CLI outputs clean, uniform JSON lines stripped of Substrate metadata, perfectly matching standard `kubectl logs` behavior:

```bash
$ kubectl ate logs actors test -a demo
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:49:15.23700774Z","message":"Actor started"}
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:49:15.23700774Z","level":"INFO","msg":"Starting counter server on port 80"}
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:49:15.255765354Z","count":0,"fshash":"mCY7G4S318ztOUojPTF2NA/W+ZSmWyr+T5K3udFuP50","level":"INFO","msg":"Count"}
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:49:25.263744806Z","count":1,"fshash":"mCY7G4S318ztOUojPTF2NA/W+ZSmWyr+T5K3udFuP50","level":"INFO","msg":"Count"}
```

#### Example 3: Streaming/Live Logs (`--follow` or `-f`)
To stream actor logs in real-time, append the `--follow` (or `-f`) flag. The CLI is fully actor-aware, automatically resuming the stream if the actor is suspended or migrates to a different worker pod:

```bash
$ kubectl ate logs actors test -a demo -f
Actor is currently running on pod ate-demo-counter/counter-d8f99-m7d96
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:49:15.255765354Z","count":0,"fshash":"mCY7...","level":"INFO","msg":"Count"}
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:49:25.263744806Z","count":1,"fshash":"mCY7...","level":"INFO","msg":"Count"}
Actor is currently running on pod ate-demo-counter/counter-ab123-x4y5z
{"time":"2026-05-22T21:50:02.123456789Z","count":2,"fshash":"mCY7...","level":"INFO","msg":"Count"}
```

#### Example 4: Filtering by Container
An actor can run several containers. By default every line is shown, including the synthetic lifecycle events (`Actor started`, `Actor checkpointing`, ...). `--container` (short form `-c`) restricts the output to the named container's logs:

```bash
kubectl ate logs actors <actor-name> -a <atespace> -c <container-name>
```

---

### Centralized Logging Backends (Multi-Dimensional Aggregation)
To view the continuous log history of actors across past and present worker pods, you can integrate Agent Substrate with any centralized logging backend (such as Grafana or Google Cloud Logging) that supports structured JSON indexing.

Because the logging pipeline indexes the core metadata labels, you can query your logs across multiple dimensions using your logging platform's query language (examples below use Google Cloud Log Explorer syntax):

#### 1. Actor-Centric View
To track the unified, continuous lifecycle of a single actor regardless of how many times it migrated across worker pods or was suspended/resumed:

```text
labels."ate.actor.name"="test"
```

#### 2. Atespace-Centric View
To monitor or debug all actor instances in a specific atespace (e.g., analyzing the collective behavior or error rates of all actors belonging to one tenant):

```text
labels."ate.atespace"="ate-demo-counter"
```

#### 3. Template-Centric View
To monitor or debug all actor instances created from a specific ActorTemplate (e.g., analyzing the collective behavior or error rates of all counter actors). One atespace can run actors from many templates, so this is a distinct dimension from the atespace view above:

```text
labels."ate.template.name"="counter"
```

#### 4. Pod-Centric View
To inspect the physical worker pod's aggregate stream and see all co-located actors multiplexed together (useful for investigating pod-level resource exhaustion or noisy neighbor issues):

```text
resource.labels.pod_name="counter-c995fdf4c-m7d96"
```

### Joining Logs to Traces

Substrate-emitted records carry top-level `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `trace_flags` in lowercase hex, the names the [OpenTelemetry spec](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/compatibility/logging_trace_context/) fixes for non-OTLP log formats. That covers component logs (every `slog.*Context` call, via [`internal/contextlogging`](../internal/contextlogging)) and the synthetic actor lifecycle records, so a suspend or resume log line joins the RPC that drove it.

An actor's **own** lines carry trace context only if the actor emits these fields itself, in which case they pass through unchanged. Substrate cannot supply them: one forwarder goroutine covers a container's whole output stream and cannot tell which request produced a given line. Per-line correlation for actor logs arrives with the actor telemetry relay ([#853](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/issues/853)), where the actor's own SDK carries the context.

---

### Actor-Attributed Component Logs

A component's own `slog` output can also be about a specific actor. Those records take the identity keys from [`internal/ateattr`](../internal/ateattr) too, flat at the top level rather than inside a label group: a component writes no envelope, so a collector lifts the keys straight onto the log record's attributes. `ateattr.ActorLogAttrs` and `ateattr.ActorLogLabels` return the same five keys for this reason, and a test holds them together. Filtering on `ate.actor.uid` therefore finds a component record and an actor's own output alike.

atelet's `Restore timing breakdown` and `Checkpoint timing breakdown` are the unsampled per-actor latency records Substrate produces. Each is emitted once per operation, whether it succeeded or failed; a failed one also carries `error.type` (the gRPC code, `DeadlineExceeded` and `Canceled` for context errors), so a reader can leave it out of a latency distribution:

```json
{"time":"…","level":"INFO","msg":"Restore timing breakdown",
 "ate.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.actor.name":"counter-1","ate.actor.uid":"8f2a…",
 "ate.template.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.template.name":"counter",
 "ate.snapshot.scope":"full","ate.snapshot.kind":"latest","ate.sandbox.class":"gvisor",
 "ate.actor.restore.duration.download":0.310,
 "ate.actor.restore.duration.oci_unpack":0.050,
 "ate.actor.restore.duration.ateom_restore":0.060,
 "ate.actor.restore.duration.total":0.420,
 "trace_id":"4bf92f…","span_id":"00f067…","trace_flags":"01"}
```

The duration keys are the [`ate.actor.restore.duration`](#the-metric-registry) instrument's name with an `ate.snapshot.phase` value appended, and they hold **seconds**, matching that instrument's declared unit. The same rules apply as on the histogram: a phase that never ran is absent rather than zero, and phases overlap and do not sum to the total. There is no `ate.snapshot.phase` key on the record — on a datapoint it names the one step timed, and this record carries them all.

This is the record to use for a per-actor wake-up distribution. The histogram cannot answer that question at all, because actor identity is barred from metric labels; traces can, but the data plane is head-sampled at 1%.

ateom-microvm writes records with the same two messages, from inside the `ateom_restore` and `ateom_checkpoint` phases, under `ateom.actor.restore.duration.<phase>` and `ateom.actor.checkpoint.duration.<phase>` (for example `vm_restore`, `wakeup_probe`, `prep`, `pause`, `snapshot`, `teardown`). Those keys are not instruments: the phases are implementation details of one runtime, so they stay a developer-facing record. The same identity keys make the two layers' records joinable per actor. The checkpoint record is written on failure too, with `error.type` and the elapsed time of the step that failed; the restore record is written on success only. The restore phases are sequential and partition the total; a checkpoint's `snapshot`, `durable_dir` and `rootfs_upper` run concurrently on the paused guest, so the paused window costs their maximum, not their sum.

ateapi's `Actor state changed` is written once per committed actor state transition. ateapi owns the state machine, so this is where an actor's state and the time it reached it come from:

```json
{"time":"…","level":"INFO","msg":"Actor state changed",
 "ate.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.actor.name":"counter-1","ate.actor.uid":"8f2a…",
 "ate.template.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.template.name":"counter",
 "ate.actor.operation.name":"suspend","ate.actor.state":"suspended",
 "trace_id":"4bf92f…","span_id":"00f067…","trace_flags":"01"}
```

`ate.actor.state` takes the `ateapipb.ActorState` values lowercased, so the log vocabulary and the state machine cannot fork. The last record for an actor's uid is the state it is in now, and its timestamp is when that state began. Query it per actor, not in aggregate: neither key is a metric label, because both only ever appear beside actor identity, which [the cardinality rules](#the-metric-registry) keep off metrics entirely.

`ate.actor.operation.name` says which operation drove the transition, which the state alone does not: an actor reaches `suspended` from a suspend and `paused` from a pause, and the two differ in whether the worker was released.

The record goes out after the store commit, never before, and the state is read straight off the committed record rather than named by the caller. Every state commit has a version check too, so if two writers race, the one that lost writes nothing. You will never see a state here that the store did not actually hold.

Creating an actor counts as a change. A new actor is born suspended, so it gets a record saying so, with `ate.actor.operation.name` set to `create`. Otherwise an actor that is created and never resumed would have no record at all, no matter how long you keep your logs.

`deleted` is the only state with no `ateapipb.ActorState` behind it. It is written once the actor row is gone, so there is nothing left to read back. It is also the last record an actor ever gets. Without it, `deleting` would be the end of the story, and a delete that finished would look just like one that got stuck.

**What this stream won't tell you.** It only writes when something changes. So an actor that has been sitting in the same state since before your logs roll over has no record, and no state. Ask the control plane what state something is in right now. Use this stream to see how it got there and when. Records can also go missing, like any other log, and a gap looks the same as an actor that just sat still. If you want to count activations, use the router's access log instead.

`Actor crashed` is the exception, and carries the same two keys with `ate.actor.state="crashed"`. It is written once per committed transition into `ACTOR_STATE_CRASHED`, beside the [`ate.actor.crashes`](#the-metric-registry) increment and under the same already-crashed guard, so the two can never disagree about how many crashes happened. A consumer deriving state therefore selects on `ate.actor.state` under ateapi's resource (`service.name=ateapi`), not on the message. The resource is what makes the record authoritative. [The ateom relay](#the-ateom-otlp-relay) admits only ateom resources, so once worker pods have no direct path to the collector, a record carrying these keys under any other resource cannot come from a worker pod. Until then this is a rule the consumer applies, not one the transport enforces.

```json
{"time":"…","level":"ERROR","msg":"Actor crashed",
 "ate.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.actor.name":"counter-1","ate.actor.uid":"8f2a…",
 "ate.template.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.template.name":"counter",
 "ate.actor.operation.name":"resume","ate.actor.state":"crashed",
 "trace_id":"4bf92f…","span_id":"00f067…","trace_flags":"01"}
```

The counter carries no actor identity, so this record is the only way to attribute a crash to one agent. The decision-point line that precedes it (`Setting Actor to crashed due to error`) carries only `ate.atespace` and `ate.actor.name`: it is written before the Actor is loaded, so no uid exists yet.

#### The same records over OTLP

With `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp` these records go out as OTLP log events instead of stdout, so a collector reads them without knowing substrate's stdout envelope. Unset or `none`, which is what every environment but kind uses today, keeps them on stdout. `otlp,console` writes both, as kind does for debugging. `console` here is the component's own JSON log line, not the OTel SDK's console exporter format. The value is a comma-separated list: names are trimmed, lowercased, and counted once, and an unknown or empty item logs a warning and is skipped while the rest apply. `none` with an exporter, or a value that names no known exporter, logs a warning and keeps the default, `none`. ateapi is the only emitter today. The ateoms have a LoggerProvider on the same switch and export through [the ateom relay](#the-ateom-otlp-relay), which carries logs, traces, and metrics. atecontroller copies `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` into each worker pod, so the kind ConfigMap sets the ateoms to `otlp,console` too.

Three `event.name` values, which is the OTLP LogRecord's own field rather than an attribute:

| `event.name` | Body | Severity | Attributes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ate.actor.state_changed` | `Actor state changed` | 9 | the five identity keys, `ate.actor.operation.name`, `ate.actor.state` |
| `ate.actor.crashed` | `Actor crashed` | 17 | the same keys |
| `ate.actor.usage_sampled` | `Actor usage sampled` | 9 | the five identity keys, `ate.workerpool.*`, `ate.sandbox.class`, `ate.stats.*`, `ate.actor.epoch` |

`ate.actor.usage_sampled` is the ateoms' record: one per actor per sampling period, plus an `initial` and a `final` per activation, told apart by `ate.stats.kind`. Its timestamp is when the measurement was read. Its measurements are named after the `ate.actor.stats.*` instruments and share their units, so `ate.stats.cpu.time` is seconds. They are absent, not zero, while the actor is not measurable, which the record says with `ate.stats.source` unspecified. `ate.stats.cpu.time` restarts at zero with each `ate.actor.epoch`, the unix-nano time the activation began, so a lifetime figure is the sum over epochs of each epoch's highest value; `ate.stats.memory.usage` and `ate.stats.memory.working_set` are absolute, and `ate.stats.memory.peak` is as the source reports it. The same measurements ride `WorkloadStatsSample` on the stats RPCs, with the epoch beside them.

A crash is its own name because an event name promises a set of attributes and a crash has a different severity and shape. There is no name per state: `ate.actor.state` already says which transition happened, so a consumer still selects on that one attribute and needs no map from a name to a state. All three names are in [`docs/metrics/registry/events.yaml`](metrics/registry/events.yaml), which `make verify` checks.

The attributes are the same flat `ate.*` keys as the stdout record, so they arrive as real log attributes with no transform in front of them. Trace context is not among them: it goes on the record's own `TraceId` and `SpanId` fields, where the stdout record's top-level `trace_id`/`span_id` would be mapped to anyway. The instrumentation scope is `github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/internal/actorevent` for every actor event. Select or drop a stream by `event.name`: the lifecycle events must never be sampled, the usage samples may be.

**Never sample or filter the lifecycle stream.** A consumer takes the last event for an actor's uid, so one dropped record reports a stale state with no sign that anything is missing. This is the one stream where a sampling policy is a correctness bug rather than a cost trade.

**Each record goes to one place unless asked otherwise.** With `otlp` it goes to OTLP, and otherwise to stdout, so a backend that also collects pod stdout, as GKE's logging agent does, does not store it twice. With `otlp` the records are not in `kubectl logs`. `otlp,console` writes both on purpose; on a cluster that also collects pod stdout, that stores each record twice, and the collector should drop one copy by `event.name`.

**With `otlp` alone, a lifecycle record can be lost.** The OTLP processor batches, and it drops records with no signal when its queue is full, when the collector stays unreachable after retries, or when the process exits ungracefully. Records written after the component's logger provider shuts down go to stdout. That shutdown runs last, after the server drains, so records written during the drain are still queued and are lost if the final export fails. Where a lost lifecycle record is not acceptable, set `otlp,console` to keep the stdout record as well.

### Per-Actor Usage Events

atelet emits one usage record per **executing** actor per sampling tick, from the same sweep that feeds the [`ate.actor.stats.*` metrics](#the-metric-registry). The two are the halves of one split: the metrics aggregate to the bounded template/pool label set a TSDB can hold, and everything carrying actor identity travels here, on the log stream, where cardinality is free. An idle fleet is silent by design — a worker with no executing actor emits nothing.

```json
{"time":"…","level":"INFO","msg":"Actor usage sample",
 "logging.googleapis.com/labels":{
   "ate.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.actor.name":"counter-1","ate.actor.uid":"8f2a…",
   "ate.template.atespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.template.name":"counter",
   "ate.workerpool.namespace":"ate-demo-counter","ate.workerpool.name":"counter-pool"},
 "kind":"periodic","sandbox_class":"gvisor","source":"cgroup",
 "memory_current_bytes":39845888,"memory_peak_bytes":52428800,
 "memory_working_set_bytes":31457280,"cpu_usage_usec":196776,
 "observed_at_unix_nano":1788903245000000000}
```

* **Identity** rides in the same label group as the actor lifecycle events and container logs (`labels` off GCE, `logging.googleapis.com/labels` on GCE, which Cloud Logging promotes into `LogEntry.labels`), so every [query dimension above](#centralized-logging-backends-multi-dimensional-aggregation) applies unchanged, and one filter returns an actor's output, transitions, and usage interleaved. The pool pair is present when the worker pod resolved to a WorkerPool and absent otherwise, the same rule as on the metrics.
* **Consumers filter on** `msg` plus `kind`. `kind` is `periodic` today; future kinds (lifecycle brackets) will join on the same record shape:

```text
labels."ate.actor.uid"="8f2a…" AND jsonPayload.msg="Actor usage sample"
```

* **The measurements** mirror the wire sample. `memory_current_bytes` and `memory_working_set_bytes` are point-in-time (current includes reclaimable page cache; the working set does not, and is the figure to compare against a memory limit). `memory_peak_bytes` and `cpu_usage_usec` **accumulate within the current epoch** (peak reads the cgroup's `memory.peak`, so it is zero on kernels older than 5.19 — unmeasured, not measured-as-zero), whose boundary depends on `source`: the `cgroup` source (host cgroup, gVisor) restarts both at zero on every restore, while the `guest-agent` source (inside the micro-VM) keeps counting across restores. Either way, per-actor CPU over a window is the increase between two samples, never a sum of raw values — and a decrease means the counter reset, not negative usage.
* **Cadence and switch**: `--actor-stats-poll-interval` on atelet governs the sweep (default `1m`, floor `50s`, `0` disables the metrics and the events together).
* **No trace context**: the sweep serves no request, so there is no span to join — the [Joining Logs to Traces](#joining-logs-to-traces) fields are absent on these records.
* **Delivery is best-effort, decoupled from node health**: the records ride atelet's stdout behind a bounded queue, so a stalled log consumer costs events (with a `Usage events dropped` warning on recovery), never the sweep or the metrics. The feed does not honor atelet's `--log-level` — a node quieted to `warn` keeps emitting usage data; the interval flag is the only switch.

**Do not put actor identity on a log-based metric.** Aggregating these events in the log store is what they are for, but a log-based metric built over them must label only by the bounded set (template, sandbox class, source, pool) — promoting `ate.actor.uid` or `ate.actor.name` into a metric label reintroduces exactly the per-actor cardinality this split keeps out of the TSDB.

## 2. Metrics

Agent Substrate emits foundational OpenTelemetry system and server metrics to monitor the overall health and performance of the control plane services. Every metric below is emitted by a service binary over OTLP and is **independent of the deployment** — a Kind dev cluster gets the same instruments as production; only the backend differs (see [Where Telemetry Goes](#4-where-telemetry-goes)).

> [`docs/metrics/registry/metrics.yaml`](metrics/registry/metrics.yaml) defines each instrument. Read it when you need all the labels, the bucket limits, or the permitted values of a label. The table below does not have each instrument. The request-parking instruments and the actor resource-usage instruments (`ate.actor.stats.*`) are in the registry only. Refer to [The metric registry](#the-metric-registry); per-actor usage detail is the [events channel](#per-actor-usage-events)'s job.

| Metric | Emitted by | Type | Measures |
|--------|------------|------|----------|
| `rpc.server.call.duration` | ateapi & atelet (gRPC servers, via `otelgrpc`) | histogram | per-method gRPC latency, request rate, and errors (labels `rpc.method`, `rpc.response.status_code`) |
| `ate.actor.crashes` | ateapi | counter | Number of times actors transitioned to `ACTOR_STATE_CRASHED` (labels `ate.actor.operation.name`, `ate.template.atespace`, `ate.template.name`, `ate.workerpool.namespace`, `ate.workerpool.name`, `ate.sandbox.class`) |
| `atenet.router.route.duration` | atenet-router | histogram | Substrate E2E — Envoy receiving a request to Envoy forwarding it to the resolved worker, excluding actor compute and the response (labels `ate.template.atespace`, `ate.template.name`, `ate.router.outcome`, `ate.router.resume`) |
| `atelet.snapshot.size` | atelet | histogram | uncompressed allocated size in bytes of each snapshot image written during checkpoint (`st_blocks * 512`, excluding sparse holes in micro-VM `memory-ranges`) (labels `file.name`, `ate.template.atespace`, `ate.template.name`) |
| `ate.workerpool.desired_workers` | atecontroller | up/down counter | number of worker pods requested for a WorkerPool, from `spec.replicas` (labels
`ate.workerpool.namespace`, `ate.workerpool.name`) |
| `ate.workerpool.ready_workers` | atecontroller | up/down counter | number of worker pods currently ready for a WorkerPool, from `status.readyReplicas` (labels
`ate.workerpool.namespace`, `ate.workerpool.name`) |
| `ate.workerpool.workers` | ateapi | up/down counter | live worker count per pool, split by state (`idle`/`partial`/`at_capacity`/`unschedulable`) and sandbox class to provide fleet capacity and saturation at a glance |
| `ate.actor.lifecycle.operation.duration` | ateapi | histogram | how long each actor operation (create/resume/suspend/pause/delete/revert) takes and whether it failed (`error.type` present = failure, absent = success); labeled by operation, template, pool (`ate.workerpool.namespace` + `ate.workerpool.name`), sandbox class, and snapshot kind and scope on resume; already-running resume no-ops are not recorded so the histogram tracks actual activations, not router traffic |
| `ate.scheduler.assignment.duration` | ateapi | histogram | time it takes for an actor to be assigned to a worker, per attempt (version-conflict retries record only the final attempt), with the outcome (`assigned` / `no_capacity` / `error`), the assigned pool (`ate.workerpool.namespace` + `ate.workerpool.name`) and sandbox class to catch scheduling latency and capacity starvation problems |
| `ate.actor.restore.duration` | atelet | histogram | how long each phase of a restore takes on the worker node, which is where cold-start latency actually goes once ateapi hands off (labels `ate.snapshot.phase`, `ate.snapshot.kind`, `ate.snapshot.scope`, `ate.template.atespace`, `ate.template.name`, `ate.sandbox.class`) |
| `ate.actor.checkpoint.duration` | atelet | histogram | the same phase breakdown for writing a snapshot, so a slow suspend can be attributed to ateom or to the upload (same labels as the restore histogram) |
| `ate.imagecache.requests` | atelet | counter | image lookups in the node-local image cache, by outcome (`ate.imagecache.outcome`), with `error.type` on the `error` outcome. A miss pays for the pull and the unpack, so the hit ratio per node is a leading indicator of resume latency |

The table lists the OpenTelemetry instrument names. How a name appears in a query depends on the backend (Cloud Monitoring (GMP) / Kind collector).

For `ate.workerpool.desired_workers` and `ate.workerpool.ready_workers`:
* **Supply-Side Saturation Golden Signal**: Measures whether commanded capacity was delivered. Dedicated instruments match Kubernetes semantic conventions (`k8s.deployment.desired_pods` / `k8s.deployment.available_pods`) because desired + ready is not a disjoint sum.
* **Autoscaling Control Loop & Anti-Windup**: `desired - ready > 0` sustained beyond a few minutes indicates undelivered capacity due to node pool exhaustion, quota limits, or stuck worker pods, serving as anti-windup input for demand-reactive capacity scaling.

For `atenet.router.route.duration`:
* `ate.router.outcome` categorizes the route attempt result: `ok`, `cancelled`, `timeout`, `no_capacity`, `failed_precondition`, `lock_conflict`, `not_found`, `unavailable`, `rate_limited`, or `resume_error`.
* The router and the scheduler both report `no_capacity` for one condition, but they count different events. The scheduler records one sample on `ate.scheduler.assignment.duration` for each assignment attempt. The router records one sample for each request. Many requests can join one resume, and one parked request can cause more than one attempt. Thus do not compare the two counts directly.
* `ate.router.resume` indicates the singleflight execution state of actor resumption: `none` (the resume found the actor already running), `triggered` (this request completed a cold activation), `joined` (this request waited on another request's resume, which activated the actor), or `unknown` (the resume did not complete, so whether an activation ran is unknown). `ate.template.atespace` and `ate.template.name` hold `unknown` when the router has no template to name.

For `ate.imagecache.requests`:
* `ate.imagecache.outcome` is `hit` when the node holds a complete image record — every layer directory the record names is present — and `miss` when the lookup must pull. A failed lookup is neither: `error` is a failed lookup whatever the cause, and `cancelled` or `timeout` is the caller giving up, as on `ate.router.outcome`. So the hit ratio is `hit / (hit + miss)`, with failures and abandoned lookups out of the denominator.
* `error.type` is present only on the `error` outcome, and carries the registry's own HTTP status for its rejection, from a fixed set: `401`, `403`, `404`, `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504`. The set is an allow-list because the registry client reports whatever the remote returned. Each other status, and each failure that carries no status, reports `_OTHER`.

`ate.workerpool.namespace` and `ate.workerpool.name` identify a pool together, on every instrument that names one. A WorkerPool is a namespaced resource, so the name on its own merges same-named pools from different namespaces into one series. The pair means that capacity (`ate.workerpool.workers`, `ate.workerpool.desired_workers`, `ate.workerpool.ready_workers`) joins to demand (`ate.scheduler.assignment.duration`, `ate.actor.lifecycle.operation.duration`, `ate.actor.crashes`) by pool.

**No keys** means the operation has no pool. The actor-centric instruments omit the pair, so a crash before the actor reached a worker, or the `no_capacity` outcome, names no pool. No instrument sends the pair with both keys empty.

The three snapshot labels are orthogonal and mean the same thing on every histogram that carries them:
* `ate.snapshot.kind`: which snapshot the operation reads or writes. `local` (node-local, written by a pause), `latest` (the actor's own durable snapshot), `golden` (the template's image), or `boot` (from scratch, so it never appears on the atelet histograms).
* `ate.snapshot.scope`: what content it covers. `full` or `data`.
* `ate.snapshot.phase`: which step was timed. `volume_mount`, `manifest_fetch`, `sandbox_assets`, `download`, `oci_unpack`, `ateom_restore` on restore; `sandbox_assets`, `ateom_checkpoint`, `persist` on checkpoint; `total` on both.

**Phases overlap and do not sum to `total`.** The download runs concurrently with the asset fetch and OCI unpack, so each is an independent observation; use `total` as the denominator. A phase that never started is absent rather than zero.

The `ate.*` control-plane metric labels are either fixed value sets (operation, outcome, state, class, kind, scope, phase) or scoped to the deployment catalog (template and pool names are operator-created, never derived from request payloads), and the label set varies per operation: resume carries the most dimensions, delete only the operation and error type. `ate.sandbox.class` is derived from the template (each template has exactly one class), so it adds no extra series next to the template labels; it exists so dashboards can aggregate by class without enumerating template names. High-cardinality actor identity (name/uid/atespace) stays off metrics entirely and lives on logs and traces instead — for resource usage, on the [per-actor usage events](#per-actor-usage-events).

### The metric registry

[`docs/metrics/registry/metrics.yaml`](metrics/registry/metrics.yaml) defines each instrument that the ate system components send, every attribute any signal uses, and the permitted values of each. [`events.yaml`](metrics/registry/events.yaml) beside it defines the [log events](#the-same-records-over-otlp). Use them as the only source of this data.

A few attributes are defined there but barred from metric labels — actor identity above all. The `note` on each says so, and the cardinality rules below are where the bar lives.

It is an [OpenTelemetry Weaver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver) registry. Weaver reads the whole directory, resolves each `ref`, and refuses a group or an attribute that is not correct:

```sh
hack/verify/metrics.sh                           # the command that CI uses
weaver registry check -r docs/metrics/registry   # the same command, direct
```

`make verify` runs the script. It uses a local `weaver` binary if there is one, and the official image if there is none.

**To add or change an instrument:** follow [Metrics Best Practices](dev/best-practices/metrics.md), which covers the instrument choice, the labels, the Go, the test, and the registry entry; then change `metrics.yaml` and run the script.

Two files, and not one:

| File | Content | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/metrics/registry/manifest.yaml` | The name and the schema URL of the registry. | Weaver |
| `docs/metrics/registry/metrics.yaml` | The `groups`: each metric, each attribute. | Weaver |
| `docs/metrics/substrate.yaml` | The rules of Substrate that Weaver cannot hold. | A person, an agent |

Weaver permits only `groups` and `imports` at the top level of a registry file, and it refuses a file that has any other top-level key. Thus `substrate.yaml` is beside the registry directory and not in it. It records:

* **`upstream_semconv_version`** — the version of the upstream semantic conventions that Substrate borrows `error.type`, `file.name` and the `rpc.*` attributes from.
* **`bridged_metric_families`** — the metrics that atecontroller exports but Substrate does not define, as prefixes. `controller_runtime_version` records the version of controller-runtime that the list comes from.
* **`cardinality_rules`** — the rules that keep the number of series small. No rule is enforced at this time. Each rule says what could enforce it.
* **`lint_exceptions`** — the known debt.
* **`blind_spots`** — the subsystems with no metrics. Read this list before you give a cause to a fault. The store has no instruments, but each lifecycle operation uses it.

**What the check does not do.** Weaver reads the registry, and not the Go code. Thus the build stays correct if a person adds an instrument to the code and not to the registry, or renames one in the code only. `weaver registry generate` could make `internal/ateattr` from the registry, which would remove that difference for the attributes. `weaver registry live-check` could compare the registry with the telemetry of the end-to-end tests. Both are future work.

### Bridged controller-runtime metrics (atecontroller)

atecontroller bridges controller-runtime's private Prometheus registry, which the manager serves on an unscraped `:8080`, onto its OTLP reader. So `controller_runtime_*`, `workqueue_*`, `certwatcher_*`, `rest_client_*`, `leader_election_*`, `go_*`, and `process_*` reach the collector too, keeping their Prometheus names because they are upstream instruments and renaming them would break existing controller-runtime dashboards.

These can be used to answer whether the controller is keeping up, e.g. rising `workqueue_depth` or `workqueue_queue_duration_seconds` means reconciles are falling behind, and `controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total` says which controller.

`docs/metrics/substrate.yaml` records these as prefixes under `bridged_metric_families`, and not one metric at a time. The upstream library owns the names, the labels and the buckets, and a version bump can add a family. A copy in the registry becomes wrong with no signal. `controller_runtime_version` dates the list, thus a bump has an obvious place to check.

Note that controller-runtime enables native histograms on `controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds`, `workqueue_queue_duration_seconds`, and `workqueue_work_duration_seconds`, so those three arrive as OTLP exponential histograms rather than fixed-bucket ones.

A queue that has never processed an item bridges as an exponential histogram with no positive buckets, which the Telemetry API (the Cloud Monitoring OTLP endpoint) rejects on ingest. atecontroller gives each such data point one positive bucket with a count of 0 before the OTLP push (`cmd/atecontroller/metrics.go`), so an idle queue no longer causes an error every tick. The padding carries no observations, so other backends are unaffected.

### Scraping instead of pushing

ateapi, atelet, atenet-router and the credential provider also serve every instrument on their Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint. A cluster that scrapes those endpoints sets `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none` on the components, so each series reaches the backend once. With `none` the components install no OTLP metric reader and keep the Prometheus one; traces and logs are unaffected. atecontroller then registers its instruments (`ate.workerpool.*`) on controller-runtime's registry, so the manager's `:8080` serves them next to the controller-runtime families. ateom serves no endpoint of its own, so leave the variable unset on the worker pods, or it exports no metrics at all. The variable accepts `otlp` (the default) and `none`; unlike `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`, it takes no list and no `console`. Any other value logs a warning and keeps the OTLP export.

### Local Metrics with Prometheus (Kind Cluster)

For local development inside a `kind` cluster, Agent Substrate automatically provisions a Prometheus server in the `otel-system` namespace.

To explore metrics locally:

1. **Expose the Prometheus UI** via port forwarding:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n otel-system svc/prometheus 9090:9090
   ```

2. **Open the Prometheus UI** in your web browser:
   [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

3. **Query metrics**: Run `up` to confirm each component is scraped (one series per target, value `1`), then explore the `rpc_*` series via the expression browser's autocomplete. **Status > Targets** lists the discovered pods.

> **Note:** Storage is ephemeral (`emptyDir`), so metrics are lost when the Prometheus pod restarts.

> **Roadmap Note (Actor-Level Metrics):** A comprehensive metrics roadmap is under active development to support both system operators and workload analysis. Planned OpenTelemetry instrumentation focuses on control plane latency, state snapshot performance, fleet utilization density, and enriching metrics with standardized actor labels for seamless aggregation across pod transitions.

## 3. Tracing

Distributed tracing tracks the end-to-end flow of requests as they pass through the Agent Substrate gateway, router, worker pods, and external services.

Agent Substrate samples traces by default. Each component roots parentless requests at a per-component ratio (10% on the control plane components, 1% at the atenet router), overridable per component through the standard `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` / `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` environment variables. Every component uses a parent based sampler, so a client can also force a request to be traced end to end (e.g. via the `--trace` flag). Agent Substrate leverages OpenTelemetry (OTel) for context propagation across the call stack. Each traced request generates a unique trace hash/ID, which you can use to inspect the detailed request lifecycle and span hierarchy inside Google Cloud Trace or Jaeger. See the per-component defaults table in [Tracing Best Practices](dev/best-practices/tracing.md).

### Local Tracing with Jaeger (Kind Cluster)

For local development inside a `kind` cluster, Agent Substrate automatically provisions a local OpenTelemetry Collector and Jaeger instance.

To visualize traces locally:

1. **Expose the Jaeger query UI** via port forwarding:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n otel-system svc/jaeger 16686:16686
   ```

2. **Open the Jaeger UI** in your web browser:
   [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)

3. **Generate Traces**: Run a CLI command or API call with the `--trace` flag, e.g.:
   ```bash
   kubectl ate get actor -A --trace
   # or
   kubectl ate suspend actor <actor-name> -a <atespace> --trace
   ```
   The kind overlay pins `ateapi` to `parentbased_always_on`, so API calls show up even without `--trace`; the flag additionally prints the trace ID and forces sampling on every hop.

4. **Search and Inspect**: Copy the printed Trace ID from the CLI output and paste it into the Jaeger search box (top right), or select `ateapi`, `atelet`, or `ateom-gvisor` under the **Service** dropdown and click **Find Traces** to inspect detailed call stacks, DB transactions, state updates, and worker pod handoffs.

> ateom carries no manual spans — its only instrumentation is the `otelgrpc` interceptor on the gRPC surface `atelet` calls. So it produces a span for an actor lifecycle operation (`suspend`, `resume`) and nothing at all for a read like `kubectl ate get actor`. Its sampler is parent based, so a lifecycle command is traced end to end into ateom whenever `ateapi` roots a sampled trace, which the kind overlay makes unconditional; the per-component ratio never enters into it. To check whether ateom exported its spans through the [OTLP relay](#the-ateom-otlp-relay) rather than falling back to direct network egress, inspect the span's resource attributes: `ate.otlp.relay` will be set to `"relay"` (instead of `"direct"`).

> **Developer Guide:** For detailed instructions on configuring OpenTelemetry tracer providers, middleware, and exporters in your servers or clients, please refer to the [Tracing Best Practices](dev/best-practices/tracing.md) guide.

## 4. Where Telemetry Goes

Telemetry is emitted the same way everywhere; only the backend differs between a local Kind cluster and a Google Cloud (GKE) deployment. The cloud-side backends below are all **GCP services**.

| | Kind | GKE (Google Cloud) |
|---|---|---|
| Path | service → in-cluster `opentelemetry-collector` | service → Google Managed Prometheus (GMP) |
| Metrics | collector Prometheus exporter on `:8889` | Google Cloud Monitoring |
| Traces | Jaeger UI | Google Cloud Trace |
| Logs | pod stdout; ateapi's [actor lifecycle events](#the-same-records-over-otlp) also to the collector's `debug` exporter | pod stdout. No OTLP logs: `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` is unset |
| Dashboards | Not supported | Google Cloud Monitoring (see [Dashboards](#5-dashboards)) |

> In Kind, `ateapi`, `atelet`, `ate-controller`, and `atenet-router` are pointed at the in-cluster collector, and the controller propagates the endpoint to the ateom worker pods it creates, so all component telemetry lands locally.
>
> Every component reads that endpoint from the shared `ate-otel-config` ConfigMap ([`manifests/ate-install/ate-otel-config.yaml`](../manifests/ate-install/ate-otel-config.yaml), with a Kind replacement of the same name under [`manifests/ate-install/kind/`](../manifests/ate-install/kind/ate-otel-config.yaml)). Editing it does not restart the pods that consume it — follow a change with `kubectl rollout restart`.
>
> ateom workers don't read the ConfigMap at all — `ate-controller` copies the value into each worker pod at creation. A new endpoint reaches them only once the controller itself restarts, and that restart then rolls every WorkerPool Deployment, replacing the running workers along with the actors on them.

### The ateom OTLP relay

ateom is the one component that does not talk to the collector directly. It exports logs, traces, and metrics over a unix socket at `/var/lib/ate/atelet-otlp.sock`, which `atelet` serves and forwards to the collector on the node's network ([`internal/otlprelay`](../internal/otlprelay)):

```
ateom ──OTLP/gRPC over unix socket──► atelet relay ──OTLP/gRPC──► collector
```

The socket sits in the `BasePath` hostPath already mounted into both, so nothing new is mounted. `atelet` is a DaemonSet, so every ateom on a node shares one relay, and the many per-pod collector connections collapse into one per node. Four things motivate it: the worker pod runs untrusted agent code and will not need egress to the collector once direct fallback is phased out; the connection count drops; ateom's own telemetry stays clear of the transparent egress redirect it installs for the actor; and `atelet` outlives the worker pod, so spans still queued at teardown are not lost with it.

The relay is best-effort. If the socket is absent when ateom starts — `atelet` not up yet, `--otlp-relay-socket=""`, or no collector configured for the relay to forward to — ateom logs it and exports directly to `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` as before. That fallback is decided once at startup, not per export, and is stamped on telemetry as the `ate.otlp.relay` resource attribute (`relay` vs `direct`).

> **Note on Network Egress Lockdown:** Complete network policy lockdown of worker pod egress to the collector is planned as a Phase 2 milestone once the relay path is fully proven and direct fallback is deprecated. While the fallback path remains active, worker pods retain network egress to the collector and `ate-controller` continues to inject `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.

For verified ateom sources, the relay forwards each request verbatim rather than decoding and re-exporting, which is what keeps every ateom its own service in Jaeger/GCP Trace instead of being absorbed into `atelet`'s. `ate-controller` injects `k8s.pod.name`, `k8s.namespace.name`, `k8s.pod.uid`, `k8s.node.name`, and `service.instance.id` directly into `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` via the Kubernetes Downward API; because the relay preserves resources verbatim, Kubernetes attributes remain intact even though the TCP connection to the collector originates from `atelet` rather than the worker pod IP (bypassing reliance on collector-side IP-based `k8sattributes` enrichment).

Verbatim forwarding is restricted to known ateom sources and refuses anything else with `PermissionDenied`. Actor telemetry is what that excludes: actors share a hostname (`actor`) and an interior IP, so their series merge unless identity is injected from outside the actor ([#761](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/issues/761)) — a rewrite, which will be implemented as an explicit rewriting path alongside this forwarder.

### Actor telemetry needs an egress policy

An actor's own OpenTelemetry SDK does not use the relay. It dials the collector over the network like any other outbound connection, and that connection is subject to the actor egress lockdown described in [Network Egress](network-egress.md): every actor TCP connection is redirected into `atunnel` and carried to the egress gateway, which refuses anything the actor's `EgressPolicy` does not allow. An actor with no policy, or a policy with no matching rule, cannot reach the collector at all. The SDK sees `Unavailable: connection reset by peer` on each export, and the gateway logs `egress denied: actor has no egress policy`.

To let an actor export, give it an `http` rule naming the collector's Service and the OTLP ports. It must be an `http` rule, not `https`: the OTLP/gRPC exporter is gRPC over cleartext HTTP/2 (h2c) on `4317`, which an `http` rule admits, and the OTLP/HTTP exporter is cleartext HTTP/1.1 on `4318`. On Kind the collector is `opentelemetry-collector.otel-system.svc`; on GKE with the managed collector it is `opentelemetry-collector.gke-managed-otel.svc.cluster.local`. Whatever the name, it has to match the host the actor's `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` names, because the rule is matched on the request authority.

```bash
# Kind
kubectl ate create egress-policy <actor-name> -a <atespace> -f - <<'EOF'
rules:
- http:
    hostnames: ["opentelemetry-collector.otel-system.svc"]
    ports:
      numbers: [4317, 4318]
EOF

# GKE, with the managed OpenTelemetry collector
kubectl ate create egress-policy <actor-name> -a <atespace> -f - <<'EOF'
rules:
- http:
    hostnames: ["opentelemetry-collector.gke-managed-otel.svc.cluster.local"]
    ports:
      numbers: [4317, 4318]
EOF
```

An actor that already has a policy for other destinations keeps those rules and gains this one: `kubectl ate update egress-policy` replaces the whole rule list, so include the existing rules in the manifest. `kubectl ate get egress-policy <actor-name> -a <atespace> -o yaml` prints the current one.

Three things to know when applying this:

* **It is per actor.** The policy is a resource under the actor, and nothing applies one by default today. Every actor that exports telemetry needs its own, created after the actor and before, or shortly after, it is resumed. A template-level default policy is proposed in [#1558](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/pull/1558); the underlying ask is [#1430](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/issues/1430).
* **A running actor recovers slowly.** If the policy is created while the actor is already exporting and failing, the SDK's gRPC client is in reconnect backoff and the gateway caches the missing policy for `--egress-policy-cache-ttl` (10s by default). Expect the first successful export 45s to two minutes after the policy appears. An actor whose policy exists before it starts has no such delay.
* **The collector sees the gateway, not the actor.** The TCP connection to the collector comes from the egress gateway pod, so a collector that enriches by source IP (the `k8sattributes` processor, which the GKE managed collector runs) labels the actor's spans and metrics with the gateway's `k8s.pod.name`, `k8s.deployment.name=atenet-egress`, and `k8s.namespace.name`. The actor's `service.name` and anything it puts in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` survive. Set the actor's identity there yourself if you need it on the backend; the relay-based path that will do this for actors is tracked in [#853](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/issues/853) and [#761](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate/issues/761).

**Logs written to stdout and stderr need none of this.** ateom reads a container's output stream inside the worker pod and writes it to the pod's own stdout, which is where [`kubectl ate logs`](#active-actor-inspection-via-cli) and a node log agent pick it up. That path never leaves the sandbox over the network, so it is untouched by the egress lockdown and works for an actor with no policy at all. The policy is only for telemetry an SDK inside the actor pushes itself: traces, metrics, and OTLP logs if `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp` is set in the actor.

Substrate puts no OTLP configuration into an actor container. Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in the ActorTemplate's container `env`; without it the SDK defaults to `localhost:4317`, where nothing listens inside the sandbox, and every export is dropped with no error at the collector.

## 5. Dashboards

> **GCP-specific.** These are **Google Cloud Monitoring** dashboards; they apply only to a GKE / Google Cloud deployment. There is no dashboard support on Kind — use the Prometheus UI in [Metrics](#2-metrics) for local development.

Dashboard definitions live in [`tools/setup-gcp/dashboards/`](../tools/setup-gcp/dashboards/) (see its README for the per-dashboard breakdown). They are created and updated **as part of GCP setup**: `tools/setup-gcp` applies each dashboard idempotently (matched and updated by display name), so re-running is safe.

```sh
go run ./tools/setup-gcp create dashboards   # also part of: bootstrap
```
