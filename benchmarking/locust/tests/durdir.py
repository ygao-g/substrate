"""Stub DurdirUser declaration.

The real load implementation lives in the boomer-Go worker at
cmd/benchmarking/boomer-glutton/; this Python class is declared only so the
master recognizes the name and attributes boomer's stats rows to it. The
master loads this stub file (or glutton.py), selected by
${BENCHMARK_USER_CLASS} in locust/manifests/locust.yaml. The Python worker
container sets LOCUST_NO_DURDIR_USER=1 to skip loading this file, leaving
boomer as the sole owner of DurdirUser load.
