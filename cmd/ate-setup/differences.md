# ate-setup vs. the install shell scripts

`ate-setup` is a Go port of `hack/install-ate.sh`, the seven
`hack/install-demo-*.sh` scripts it sources, and `hack/setup-csi-*-kind.sh`.

The shell scripts are still present and still work; this is an additive
alternative to them, not yet a replacement. Retiring them behind compatibility
shims is left to a follow-up, so for now the two installers coexist and either
can be used against the same cluster. See [`commands.md`](commands.md) for the
flag-by-flag mapping between them.

This document covers what changed *behind* that mapping. For anything not listed
here, the port is intended to be behavior-preserving.

## What is deliberately unchanged

These were treated as contracts and reproduced exactly:

- **Step log lines.** `log.Step` prints the same cyan `[step]: name` and the
  same step names (`deploy_ate_system`, `create_api_server_env_vars`,
  `demo-counter_deploy (with_external_volume=true)`), so CI log scrapers keep
  working.
- **Manifest ordering.** Applying a directory is non-recursive and lexical, as
  `kubectl apply -f <dir>` was. `deploy_ate_system` depended on that ordering
  and the shell comments called out specific filename hazards, so
  `kube.LoadPath` keeps it.
- **Overlay selection.** `steps.SystemOverlay` is the same product of
  kind × router that `render_ate_system_manifests` computed with
  nested `if`s.
- **Timeouts.** 60s namespace, 60s rollout (`--rollout-timeout` /
  `ATE_INSTALL_ROLLOUT_TIMEOUT`, as in the scripts), 120s for the
  podcertificate-controller and CSI waits the scripts fixed there, 300s demo.
  `--rollout-timeout` now reaches the 120s waits too, which it did not in the
  shell, but only when it is passed: `Config.WaitTimeout` leaves each site at
  its historical value otherwise, so the 60s default cannot shorten the slow
  bootstrap paths.
- **Rendered bytes.** `authentication.yaml` is trimmed of its trailing newline
  because the shell built it inside `$(...)`, which strips them. Switching
  between the two installers must not rewrite the ConfigMap.
- **ko's ldflags.** `make ldflags` emitted `-X=<version pkg>.Version=$(git
  describe --tags --always --dirty)`; `ko.Runner.ldflags` computes the identical
  string without depending on make.

## Execution model

| | shell | ate-setup |
|---|---|---|
| Actions per run | many, one per flag, in command-line order | exactly one subcommand |
| Argument errors | detected when the dispatch loop reaches the flag, after earlier actions already ran | rejected by cobra before anything runs |
| Value flags | pre-scanned so they could appear anywhere | positional, per-command, standard flag parsing |
| Configuration | env vars (`ATE_INSTALL_KIND`, `ATE_ATENET_ROUTER`, `KUBECTL_CONTEXT`, …) | flags, with the env vars still honored as defaults |
| Repository root | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, then `cd` | walk up for `go.mod`; no `chdir`, all paths absolute |

The one-action-per-run change is the most visible: a line that passed
`--deploy-ate-system --deploy-demo-counter` becomes two `ate-setup` calls.
`hack/install-ate.sh` still accepts the combined form.

Invalid input now fails before any cluster mutation. `--atenet-router=nginx`
used to be caught by a pre-scan validation pass; `--worker-count 0` was not
caught at all and surfaced from inside `deploy_locust.sh` after the microvm
dependencies had already been installed.

`.ate-dev-env.sh` is still sourced through bash — a developer's file can contain
arbitrary shell — but its variables are then layered under the process
environment and the flags rather than being exported wholesale.

## External binaries

Dropped entirely: **kubectl**, **kubectl kustomize**, **jq**, **openssl**,
**sed**, **base64**, **grep**, **make**, and `go run ./cmd/kubectl-ate`.

Still required, and why:

| Binary | Used for |
|---|---|
| `ko` | building and publishing images (`ko resolve` only) |
| `go` | locating the pinned `ko` tool, exactly as `hack/run-tool.sh` does |
| `git` | the `git describe` version stamp passed to ko |
| `docker` | the kind CSI setup (`docker exec` into the node) and the claude-code-multiplex workload build |
| `gcloud` | GKE `get-credentials`, only when `PROJECT_ID` is set and no context was given |
| `bash` | sourcing `.ate-dev-env.sh` |

Two shell scripts are still invoked rather than reimplemented, because they
orchestrate image builds, asset assembly, and object-store staging that are out
of scope for an installer: `benchmarking/deploy_locust.sh` and
`hack/install-microvm-deps.sh`. They receive `Config.ScriptEnv()`, which
reconstructs the environment the shell installer would have exported to them.

`ko` is no longer asked to apply anything. The scripts ran `run_ko apply`, which
made ko shell out to kubectl and forced the awkward `-- --context=` special case
(only `apply`/`create`/`delete`/`run` accept args after `--`; `resolve` rejects
them). Now ko only resolves, and the resulting manifest is applied through
client-go.

## Cluster access

**Server-side apply.** `kubectl apply -f -` is a client-side apply by default.
`ate-setup` uses SSA through the dynamic client with field manager `ate-setup`
and `force: true`. This is the supported path for repeated reconciliation and
avoids the `last-applied-configuration` annotation growing without bound on the
large generated CRDs. Objects previously applied client-side will show both
managers in `managedFields` until the next apply reconciles them.

**Discovery caching is a new failure mode.** Every `kubectl` invocation started
with a cold discovery cache, so `kubectl apply -f generated` followed by
applying a `SandboxConfig` just worked. One long-lived process keeps a cached
RESTMapper, which would keep serving the pre-CRD discovery document and report
`no matches for kind`. Three mitigations are in place: `Apply` invalidates after
a CRD document in the same stream, `DeployCRDs` invalidates explicitly, and
`resourceFor` retries once against fresh discovery before giving up.

**Rollout status is reimplemented.** `kubectl rollout status` is not a library
call, so `kube.RolloutStatus` polls Deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets
with the same conditions kubectl's status viewers use — including the
`ProgressDeadlineExceeded` check and the partitioned-StatefulSet case. Two
deliberate differences: a workload that does not exist yet is *waited for*
rather than erroring immediately, and the failure message carries the last
observed status (`3/5 replicas available`) instead of only a timeout.

**Deletes are more precise.** `kubectl delete --ignore-not-found -f` was the
model, so NotFound is ignored — and so is a kind that no longer resolves, since
teardown after the CRDs are gone must not fail. Beyond that, deletes are strict.

**`|| true` is gone.** The CSI hostpath bundle ships a `VolumeSnapshotClass`
whose CRD is absent on a stock Kind cluster; the shell script handled that by
ignoring kubectl's exit code for the whole bundle, which also hid real failures.
`ApplyTolerant` skips exactly the objects whose *kind* is unmappable, logs each
skip, and keeps everything else strict. The best-effort `docker exec` cleanup on
the Kind node stays best-effort, as before.

## Certificates and secrets

**CA pools are generated in-process.** `create_*_ca_pool_secret` shelled out to
`go run ./cmd/kubectl-ate admin make-ca-pool`, paying a compile per call.
`steps.createCAPool` calls `internal/localca` and `internal/localjwtauthority`
directly — the same libraries `kubectl-ate` uses.

**Creating an existing pool is no longer an error.** `make-ca-pool` issues a
bare `Create`, so `--create-actor-id-ca-pool-secret` against a cluster that
already had one failed with `AlreadyExists`. `ate-setup create actor-id-ca-pool`
logs `already exists; keeping it` and succeeds. It still refuses to overwrite:
regenerating would rotate the root out from under every certificate already
issued from it. (The `--deploy-ate-system` path was already guarded by
`ensure_apiserver_prerequisites`, so only the standalone `create` subcommands
change.)

**Pool extraction is exact.** `ca_pool_root_pem` piped a Secret through
`jsonpath | base64 -d | grep -o '"RootCertificateDER":"[^"]*' | sed | base64 -d
| openssl x509`. That has two problems the shell comments were already worried
about: `grep -o` returns only the **first** root, silently dropping the rest of
a multi-CA pool, and any failure in the pipeline yields an empty string that
becomes a trust bundle with no roots. `kube.CAPoolRootPEM` unmarshals the pool
with the library that wrote it, emits **every** CA's root, and returns an error
for a missing key, an undecodable pool, an empty pool, or a CA with no root
certificate.

## Demos

**A registry replaces naming conventions.** The scripts appended to an
`ATE_DEMOS` array and discovered `${name}_deploy`, `${name}_delete`,
`${name}_usage`, and `${name}_cmdline` with `declare -F`. A demo that misspelled
a function silently lost that capability. `demos.Demo` is an interface, each
demo is its own package registering itself from `init`, and
`internal/demos/all` is the single list of what gets linked in — with a test
asserting no demo package is missing from it.

**Kind-only demos are visible but refuse.** `demo-autoscaled-workerpool`
registered itself only when `ATE_INSTALL_KIND=true`, so on GKE
`--deploy-demo-autoscaled-workerpool` was rejected as an *unknown option*. The
cobra tree is built before flags are parsed, so `--kind` is not known yet; the
subcommand always exists and fails at run time with `demo-autoscaled-workerpool
is only supported for Kind installations; re-run with --kind`. `delete all`
still skips it on a non-Kind install, via `demos.For`.

**Template expansion is not sed.** The demo templates were expanded by a stack
of `sed -e` expressions doing two things: substitute `${PLACEHOLDER}`, or delete
the whole line (`/${NAME}/d`) when the placeholder is not in play.
`internal/render` implements exactly those two operations, so the output is
byte-identical, but values are no longer interpreted as sed replacement text —
an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or bucket name containing `|`, `&`, or a backslash is now
substituted literally. A placeholder that is neither substituted nor dropped is
left in place, so an unexpected template variable surfaces as invalid YAML
instead of vanishing.

**Actor cleanup uses the API directly.** `delete_demo_actors` required `jq`,
listed actors with `kubectl-ate get actors -A -o json`, and filtered with a jq
expression. `steps.DeleteDemoActors` uses `internal/ateclient` and pages through
`ListActors`. The tolerances are preserved: no `ate-api-server`, or an apiserver
that cannot be reached, skips cleanup rather than failing, because `delete all`
runs this for every demo.

**`docker buildx imagetools inspect` output is parsed as JSON**, not piped
through `jq -r '.manifest.digest'`. Build output still goes to stderr so the
stdout/stderr split matches under CI log capture.

## Errors and diagnostics

- `set -o errexit` propagated failures but could not see a failing command
  substitution inside an argument list — the case the shell comments flagged
  twice around CA extraction. Go returns errors at each call site.
- Errors are wrapped with the object they concern: `while applying
  deployment/ate-api-server -n ate-system: ...`.
- Warnings go to stderr with a `Warning:` prefix; step and progress output goes
  to stdout, as before.
- `ate-setup` with no subcommand prints the help text and exits 0, without
  loading config or touching the cluster; the script printed usage and exited 1.
  Either way nothing is installed implicitly — the subcommand naming the setup
  to run is always explicit.

## Known differences worth flagging

**`--setup-csi` on a non-Kind cluster.** The shell warns and continues;
`ate-setup setup csi` is a hard error. CSI setup only ever worked on Kind, so
the warning had nothing to offer a GKE caller but a slower path to the same
outcome.

## Testing

The shell installer had no tests. `cmd/ate-setup` has unit tests for template
rendering, overlay selection, config resolution, the authentication config, the
apiserver environment ConfigMap, delegated script arguments, manifest deletion,
and per-demo rendering.
