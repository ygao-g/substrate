// A value can arrive from a flag, an exported variable or a configuration
// file, and only the first of those is visible in the command the operator
// typed. Reporting on every run is what keeps an inherited variable or a
// forgotten file from changing an install silently. Errors name the channel
// too, but an install that succeeds with the wrong value never produces one.
//
// Every setting is listed, with the channel that supplied it. A value that
// came from a default is worth seeing for the same reason a supplied one is:
// next release it may be a different default. ReportOptions.OmitDefaults
// shortens it to what was set.
//
// A setting a channel mentions is set, whatever it is set to -- an empty
// value is a value, and is how a setting is cleared. Only an absent setting
// falls through to the layer below, which in the shell is the difference
// between "export FOO=" and "unset FOO". What an empty value means then
// depends on the kind: a string takes it literally, a bool reads it as
// false, and an int or a duration has no empty form, so it is reported as
// invalid rather than ignored.
