// Package cgroupstats reads resource usage out of a cgroup v2 directory.
//
// The gVisor ateom uses it to answer ateompb.Ateom/GetWorkloadStats: the sentry
// hosts the whole sandbox in one host process, so the sandbox's cgroup leaf is
// where the workload's memory and CPU actually show up.
//
// Every read is scoped to a caller-supplied directory rather than a hardcoded
// /sys/fs/cgroup path, which keeps the parsing testable from a fixture tree
// without root or a live sandbox. The package deliberately does not know what a
// sandbox is; it reads four numbers out of five files.
