// defaultCgroupRoot is the worker pod's own cgroup scope. The worker runs in a
// private cgroup namespace, so this path is the pod's cgroup rather than the
// host root, and runsc's per-container leaves are its direct children (see
// setupCgroupDelegation).
const defaultCgroupRoot = "/sys/fs/cgroup"

// sandboxCgroupContainer is the container whose cgroup leaf accounts for the
// sandbox as a whole.
//
// gVisor runs every container of a sandbox as threads inside one host process,
// the sentry. runsc starts that process from the root container's create and
// from inside that container's cgroup — container.createRoot wraps the sandbox
// and gofer spawn in cgroup.RunInCgroup — so the sentry lands in the leaf of
// "pause", the first container RunWorkload and RestoreWorkload create.
//
// The leaf is a direct child of the delegated scope rather than of ateom's own
// cgroup, because runsc resolves cgroupsPath against the parent of the cgroup
// it is running in: cgroup v2 forbids a cgroup from holding processes and
// delegating controllers to children at once, so runsc walks up one level to
// find a directory it is allowed to create in. setupCgroupDelegation moves
// ateom into /sys/fs/cgroup/ateom precisely so that one level up is the
// delegated scope.
//
// The actor's own containers get leaves too, since cmdCreate calls
// ensureContainerCgroupsPath for each of them, but those leaves stay empty by
// design. gVisor's setupCgroupForSubcontainer creates them with empty resources
// and explains why: "Since subcontainers run exclusively inside the sandbox,
// subcontainer cgroups on the host have no effect on them. However, some tools
// (e.g. cAdvisor) uses cgroups paths to discover new containers and report
// stats for them." They are discovery markers, not accounting.
//
// So the actor's memory and CPU are the sentry's and are charged here. That is
// why a sample is attributed to the actor rather than to a container, and why
// this reads one leaf instead of summing them — the others have nothing in them
// to sum.
//
// What the leaf holds besides the actor's own work: the sentry's own overhead
// (its Go heap, page tables, netstack) and the gofers. Process listings taken
// on a live node in #161 put runsc-sandbox and both gofers — the pause
// container's and the actor container's — in the "pause" cgroup. Those runs
// predate #496, so they establish the leaf name and the fact that everything
// lands in one leaf, not the absolute path, which #496's delegation moved under
// the pod scope.
//
// So this measures the sandbox, not the actor's processes in isolation, which
// is what the proto means by "the unit of measurement is the SANDBOX". Sizing
// and chargeback want that number, since the sentry's overhead is a cost the
// node pays for running this actor, but it is not comparable to a container
// figure from a runc-based runtime, and a mostly idle actor reads as a nonzero
// floor. Splitting the actor's share out would need the sentry's own
// accounting, which the proto already says is not reported here.
//
// The name has to agree with the cgroupsPath convention in
// runsc.ensureContainerCgroupsPath, which is "/" + containerName relative to
// the same scope.
