// TestResumeActor_ConcurrentOntoOneWorker is the regression test for a refusal
// that only concurrency produces, and that a worker hosting one actor could
// never have shown.
//
// Claiming a worker rewrites that worker's whole record, so actors activating
// onto the SAME worker are N writers compare-and-swapping one row. All but one
// lose each round. That is fine and expected -- the loser re-reads and tries
// again -- but only if the retry budget is sized for how many writers there
// are. It was five steps from 10ms, and on a real cluster that rejected 21% of
// activations at 12 in flight and 67% at 24, every one of them failing at
// ~235ms with "timed out waiting for the condition".
//
// Nothing sequential catches it: the same activations one at a time all
// succeed, which is exactly what the pre-existing resume tests do.
