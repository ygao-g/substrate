// Package agentstats turns the kata guest agent's per-container cgroup
// accounting into the resource-usage sample ateom reports.
//
// The micro-VM ateom uses it to answer ateompb.Ateom/GetWorkloadStats. The host
// cgroup is the wrong place to look on this runtime: the guest's RAM is a fixed
// allocation cloud-hypervisor takes at boot, so the host cgroup reads roughly
// the same whether the actor is idle or saturated. The numbers that move with
// the workload are the ones the guest kernel keeps, and the agent is what can
// read them.
//
// This package is deliberately pure — it converts an already-fetched
// agentpb.CgroupStats and never talks to a guest — which keeps it testable
// without a live micro-VM and, unlike the rest of the micro-VM ateom, without
// the linux build tag.

// Sample is a point-in-time reading for one container, or the sum of several.

// because both feed the same four fields of GetWorkloadStatsResponse.

// Anything the guest did not report reads as zero rather than failing the whole
// sample, for the same reason as there: a partial reading is more useful than
// none. FromCgroupStats says which fields can do that and why.

// it is exact.
//
// The guest kernel does track the true figure: every container cgroup sits
// under the shared /ateomchv parent (see StartRootfsContainer and the
// CgroupsPath defaults in internal/kata), so with hierarchical accounting the
// parent's memory.peak is the actor-level maximum this sum approximates. The
// kata-agent just has no RPC that reads a cgroup by path — StatsContainer is
// per-container only. If the agent ever grows a sandbox-level stats read, that
// replaces this summing outright.

// wrap the total to a small number and read as healthy.
