# This wraps hack/run-e2e.sh with the same Kind-specific environment that
# hack/install-ate-kind.sh uses, so the snapshot bucket and image repo match
# what was installed in the cluster. All arguments are forwarded to
# hack/run-e2e.sh (run with -h to see them).

# override reading dev env -- otherwise .ate-dev-env.sh would clobber the
# Kind values below (e.g. point snapshots at a GCS bucket that doesn't exist
# in the in-cluster rustfs, causing golden-snapshot uploads to 404).
