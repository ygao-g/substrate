// Package nodepath holds the node-level paths more than one component needs:

// DaemonSet, so one socket collapses N per-pod collector connections into one
// per-node connection.
//
// It sits directly under BasePath, which is the host directory already mounted
// at the same path into atelet and into every ateom pod, so no new volume is
// needed for ateom to reach it. Note that BasePath is mounted writable
// (workerpool_apply.go) and shared with AteomSupportSocket and the image
// cache, so a worker pod can unlink or replace this socket. Confining
// atelet-owned sockets to a subdirectory mounted read-only would be an
// improvement, but it is a property of the whole BasePath mount rather than of
// this socket — a read-only subdir needs its own volume and mount, and the pod
// keeps CAP_SYS_ADMIN. Tracked separately rather than solved here.
